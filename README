#STEP BY STEP PROTOCOL
python script/Format1.py #fitness of mutation A or B (Potentiation or Landscape) on background mutation; output file = data/MutPotentiation or data/MutLandscapes
python script/Analyze1.py #Produce a correlation matrix based on single substitution fitness landscape among all mutation backgrounds; output file = data/CorMatrix
R CMD BATCH script/Heatmap1.R #Plot a heatmap by clustering mutation background based on fitness landscape similarity; output file = data/hcMatrix
python script/Format2.py #Format Distance matrix according to the clustering in data/hcMatrix; output file = data/disMatrix
R CMD BATCH script/Heatmap2.R #Plot a heatmap by distance based on the clustering in data/hcMatrix
python script/Analyze4.py #Simulation to generate correlating cluster, and some other functions to generate hit result
python script/Analyze5.py #Generate position correlation matrix by propensity; output file = data/PropCorMatrix
R CMD BATCH script/Heatmap3.R #Plot a heatmap by distance based on the clustering in data/PropCorMatrix; output file = data/PropCorhc 
python script/Analyze6.py #Generate a compile table = data/PropInfo
python script/Analyze6.py #Generate a beta propensity table = data/BetaBenchMark
